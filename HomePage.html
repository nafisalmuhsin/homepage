	 <p> Assalamu 'alaikum warahmatullahi wa barakatuh! I upload Qur'an videos on YouTube, 
	 Instagram, and TikTok regularly. Please do make sure to follow and subscribe! I've 
	 provided the links to all of them above. My goal is to encourage more people to read
	 the Qur'an and understand its meaning in order to reap its full benefits. Another aim
	 is to have my recitations reach as many people as possible throughout the globe on all
	 platforms. This way, in sha' Allah, even after I'm gone, my recitations will be heard,
	 and I'll benefit from this in my grave as Sadaqa Jariyah! And anyone who shares the 
	 Qur'an's recitations will also receive the reward of Sadaqah Jariyah. May Allah (SWT)
	 bless every single one of you for supporting me throughout my journey!	 
     </p>

	  <h3>Earthquake in Turkey and Syria</h3>
	  <p>As many of you may know, a devastating earthquake with a magnitude of 7.8 hit our brothers and sisters in Turkey and Syria on February 6, 2023, shattering the lives of thousands of innocent people. The destruction and loss are beyond comprehension, and seeing our brothers and sisters in this condition is truly heartbreaking. It is impossible not to feel overwhelmed with emotion as we witness the desperation, suffering, and trauma of those who have been affected. And yet, through it all, the patience and resilience of some of these brothers and sisters is nothing short of awe-inspiring.

This is undoubtedly a test from Allah for both sides - a test of strength and Iman for those affected and their families, and a test of our selflessness and compassion towards those in distress and in need of aid. As Muslims, it is our duty to help those in need, and we must do everything in our power to alleviate the suffering of our brothers and sisters.

Therefore, I urge all of you to open your hearts and donate as generously as you can, for even the smallest contributions can make a world of difference to those in need. And for those who cannot donate, I ask that you keep our brothers and sisters in your thoughts and prayers, for the power of dua should not be underestimated.

May Allah bless our brothers and sisters in Turkey and Syria, and grant them the strength and patience to endure this calamity. And may He reward all those who help and support them during this difficult time. Jazak Allahu khair.
